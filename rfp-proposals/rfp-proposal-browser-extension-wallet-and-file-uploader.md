## Relevant Experience
We started a blockchain development company in Japan in 2019. Already supported by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry of Japan, we are promoting a project for secondary distribution and copyright management of manga. We also do client work such as the development of a cryptocurrency wallet.
Before that, we had been developing various projects using blockchains, such as the construction of a mining farm in Etehreum and the ID management platform.
The development languages are mainly Vue.js and Nuxt.js on the front end, and node.js, Go lang on the back end. There is also development experience in languages such as Flutter for application development.
We are interested in decentralized content management and hope to develop various services using Filecoin in the future.
